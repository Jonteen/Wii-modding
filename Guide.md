Follow these steps, and when you reach the bottom, you'll have successfully homebrewed your Wii console.

Verify Wii System Version:

The first step is to check your Wii console's system version. It doesn't matter which letter follows the version number (e.g., 4.3U, 4.3E, etc.).
If it's not on version 4.3, update your Wii console, and then continue with the process.

Check Date Settings:
Make sure your Wii console has the correct date settings. If not, adjust them to the correct date.

Obtain MAC Address:
Go to Wii Settings -> Internet -> Console Information and note down the MAC address. You'll need this for the next step.

Proceed on Your Computer:
Now, go to your computer and open https://please.hackmii.com/.
Enter the MAC address and the region letter.
Cut either the blue or red wire (it doesn't matter which).
Place all the content on the root of the SD card.

Insert the SD Card:
Insert the SD card into the Wii console's SD card slot.

Open Wii Message Board:
Open the Wii Message Board and navigate a few days forward or backward. You should see a red letter. If not, it could be due to an incorrect region or date settings.
Next, open the letter you received. When you see the text "Press 1 to continue," proceed.

Hackmii Installer:
The Homebrew Channel and BootMii: Check if they both say "Can be installed." If not, your Wii cannot be homebrewed using this guide. If they do say "Can be installed," proceed as follows:
Click "Continue."
Click "Install the Homebrew Channel."
Click "Yes, continue."
When you see "Success," click "Continue."
Now, choose "Exit."
Your Wii will boot into the Homebrew Channel.

USBLoaderGX Instructions

If you are using a USB flash drive, make sure that it is formatted as FAT32 and inserted to port 0, it should also have a folder named "wbfs" on the root of the SD card, where you can place your Wii games.
I cannot assist with the process of preparing your USB drive with games. 

If you have placed the wii games in the "wbfs" folder on the SD card, you may encounter a message asking you to press "A" to use the SD card.

Congratulations on successfully homebrewing your Wii console now you can play games!

Troubleshooting:
Check to ensure that your USB flash drive is correctly formatted to FAT32. If it isn't, reformat it accordingly.

Verify that the USB flash drive is inserted into the correct USB port, which is port 0
If your Wii console is lying flat, the USB drive should be in the bottom USB port.
If your Wii is standing vertically, use the USB port closest to the edge
